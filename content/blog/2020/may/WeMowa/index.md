# 1차 프로젝트 회고록

한글번역 회고록은 부트캠프가 끝난 후 올리겠습니다 😃

Half way into the bootcamp, it was finally time for the first group project. It was about cloning an existing website, which made perfect sense, given the fact we only had two weeks to work on it.

I gave two ideas, the main was Airbnb which I really wanted to attempt to clone, and the other was Rimowa, a really pretty site which I threw the site name out there just so that I can meet minimum 2 ideas per person quota.

Ironically the Rimowa site got selected, and I along with 2 other front end developers and two back end developers got to work on this project.

The project lasted for two weeks
May 25 2020 to June 5 2020

The name of the team
WeMowa

Team composition
3 front end developers + 2 back end developers

Reference site
www.rimowa.com

The Goal
All the fancy animations and prettiness put aside, we wanted to focus on the MVP, which was enabling a smooth purchase process. That meant having properly working product list page, product details page, cart page, checkout page, and login/signup page. We decided to work on all the extras only if we had time left towards the end of the project.

What I was responsible for
I was responsible for login/signup page, product details page and cart page.

What went well
I'm pretty happy with how the login/signup page turned out to be. May not be something that can wow other people, but coming from an UX world, I know how important it is to have a perfectly working form that can collect data and retain customers. It took me almost two full days to complete it. It could've been shorter, but I sort of complicated the project more by attempting to create a satisfying user experience. I created a custom dropdown component which could be utilized throughout the site, and also enabled a tiny but mighty show/hide password functionality. One thing that I spent the most time on was error messages. As a user, it annoys the heck out of me when I get form error messages, I fix them, I click the submit button, then I realize I didn't fix something right, I get brought back to the form page with all fields reset. I wanted to solve that problem here, so that you get 3 field error messages, and you fix one right, you submit then you get brought back to the form page with 2 error messages now, and the fixed field with value in them. I'll dive deeper with my code here later.

What could've been better
Communication. To me, the back end has always been the world of mystery. However, I realized it's really really important for the front end and the back end to be curious about each other, and have goals in sync. As a front end, my goal was to ping pong data with the back end so that user completes the purchase process. So I was only focused on getting that data and felt anxious when the back end was not ready to receive the data. However the back end had their own process algorithms they had ready that they were waiting on front end to create, like search. At real workplace I'm sure there are priorities set up so this kind of problems could be minimized, but for the next project, I would really want to improve on my communication skills with the back end so that everyone could be happy 😃
